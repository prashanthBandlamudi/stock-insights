        "designSummary": "**The Neon Grid: A Fusion of Calculated Asymmetry and Electric Accents**\n\nThe Vision: We are building a dynamic and forward-thinking interface that reflects the cutting-edge nature of stock analysis and portfolio tracking. The design will evoke a sense of technological competence and sophistication, drawing inspiration from sci-fi interfaces and high-tech dashboards. The core is a dark, immersive environment punctuated by bright, electric accents and subtle gradients.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Calculated Asymmetry: The layout will utilize a modified grid system, allowing for intentional breaks and overlaps to create visual interest and a sense of depth.\n2. Electric Accents: A neon teal or magenta will be used strategically to highlight key data points, interactive elements, and visual cues.\n3. Glassmorphism and Thin Lines: Components will feature a frosted-glass look with thin, glowing lines to create a layered and futuristic feel.\n4. Data Visualization: Charts and graphs will be designed with a focus on clarity and interactivity, using smooth animations to enhance the user experience.\n5. Monospaced Details: Data points and code snippets will be displayed in a monospaced font to reinforce the \"tech\" aesthetic.",

The core is a dark, immersive environment punctuated by bright, electric accents and subtle gradients.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Calculated Asymmetry: The layout will utilize a modified grid system, allowing for intentional breaks and overlaps to create visual interest and a sense of depth.\n2. Electric Accents: A neon teal or magenta will be used strategically to highlight key data points, interactive elements, and visual cues.\n3. Glassmorphism and Thin Lines: Components will feature a frosted-glass look with thin, glowing lines to create a layered and futuristic feel.\n4. Data Visualization: Charts and graphs will be designed with a focus on clarity and interactivity, using smooth animations to enhance the user experience.\n5. Monospaced Details: Data points and code snippets will be displayed in a monospaced font to reinforce the \"tech\" aesthetic.",
